# Underwater-Visible-Light-Communication-System-VLC-
This project implements a bidirectional Visible Light Communication (VLC) system using two custom ESP32 boards. The system transmits digital messages through light using LEDs and receives them using photodiodes. The communication protocol is fully implemented in embedded firmware and can be triggered externally via MATLAB.
